Maven SCM Integration for Subversion
====================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/subclipse/m2e.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/subclipse/m2e)

This is a fork of Sonatype's Subclipse plugin for m2eclipse. They indicated
that they are no longer maintaining this plugin so we have updated it for the
latest release of Subclipse and posted it to the Subclipse p2 repository.
